- **Local Storage**: Cart and authentication persistence

### **Key Features Implemented**
1. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Material-UI breakpoints
2. **Real-time Cart**: Add items, update quantities, persistent across sessions
3. **API Integration**: All endpoints working with proper error handling
4. **Authentication Flow**: Login form, token management, protected routes
5. **Order Management**: Complete ordering workflow from cart to submission
