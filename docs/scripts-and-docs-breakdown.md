# QuickBite QA - Scripts and Documentation Breakdown

*A comprehensive guide to all deployment scripts, automation tools, and documentation files in the QuickBite QA project*

## 📜 Deployment Scripts Overview

The QuickBite QA project includes several shell scripts for deployment, testing, and maintenance. Here's what each one does:

## 🚀 Core Deployment Scripts

### `deploy-backend-aws.sh`
**Purpose**: Deploys the FastAPI backend to AWS Lambda with all dependencies

**What it does**:
1. **Dependency Installation**: Installs Lambda-specific Python packages
2. **Package Creation**: Creates deployment package with FastAPI app and dependencies
3. **Terraform Deployment**: Uses Terraform to deploy Lambda function
4. **Configuration Update**: Updates frontend configuration with new API endpoints

**Key Features**:
- Handles Lambda-specific dependency management
- Includes Mangum adapter for FastAPI-to-Lambda compatibility
- Automatic Terraform state management
- Environment variable configuration

**Usage**:
```bash
./deploy-backend-aws.sh
```

**File Structure Impact**:
```
fastapi-app/
├── lambda-deps/          # Temporary dependency directory
├── requirements-lambda.txt  # Lambda-specific requirements
└── *.py                  # FastAPI application files
```

### `deploy-to-aws.sh`
**Purpose**: Deploys the React frontend to AWS S3 with blue-green deployment support

**What it does**:
1. **AWS CLI Validation**: Checks if AWS CLI is properly configured
2. **Blue Environment Deployment**: Syncs built React app to blue S3 bucket
3. **Green Environment Deployment**: Optional staging deployment to green bucket
4. **Static Website Configuration**: Configures S3 buckets for static website hosting
5. **Public Access Setup**: Ensures proper bucket policies for public web access

**Key Features**:
- Blue-green deployment strategy

./deploy-to-aws.sh green
```

**Deployment Flow**:
```
frontend/build/ → S3 Blue Bucket → Production URL
                → S3 Green Bucket → Staging URL
```

**What it cleans**:
1. **Lambda Packages**: Removes deployment packages and zip files
2. **Build Artifacts**: Cleans React build directory
3. **Python Cache**: Removes `__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files
4. **Optional Node Modules**: Can remove node_modules if uncommented

**Usage**:
```bash
./cleanup.sh
```

**Before/After**:
```
Before:
├── fastapi-app/lambda-package/    # Removed
├── terraform/*.zip                # Removed  
├── frontend/build/                # Removed
└── **/__pycache__/               # Removed

After: Clean repository ready for commit
```
