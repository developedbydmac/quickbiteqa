```

### Backend (FastAPI)
```python
# Enhanced API endpoints:
GET    /menu              # Restaurant menu items
POST   /order             # Order placement and processing
POST   /login             # User authentication
GET    /protected         # Token-protected routes
GET    /docs              # Interactive API documentation
```

### AWS Infrastructure
```
AWS Serverless Stack:
├── S3 Buckets
│   ├── quickbite-blue    # Primary frontend hosting
│   └── quickbite-green   # Blue-green deployment
├── Lambda Functions
│   └── QuickBite API     # Serverless backend
├── API Gateway
│   └── RESTful API       # Public API endpoints
└── IAM Policies
    └── Security config   # Least-privilege access
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### React Frontend Features
```typescript
// Key Components:
- MenuBrowser: Interactive menu with filtering and search
- ShoppingCart: Real-time cart with add/remove functionality
- UserAuth: Login/logout with JWT token management
- OrderFlow: Complete ordering process from cart to confirmation
- Navigation: Responsive header with user state management
```

### FastAPI Backend Enhancement
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from mangum import Mangum  # Lambda adapter

app = FastAPI(title="QuickBite QA API")

# JWT Authentication
@app.post("/login")
async def login(credentials: UserCredentials):
    # Validate credentials and return JWT token
    return {"access_token": token, "token_type": "bearer"}

# Protected endpoints
@app.get("/protected")
async def protected_route(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    return {"message": f"Hello {current_user.username}"}

# Lambda handler
handler = Mangum(app)
```

### AWS Deployment Strategy
```bash
# Frontend deployment to S3
npm run build
aws s3 sync build/ s3://quickbite-blue --delete

# Backend deployment to Lambda
zip -r quickbite-api.zip .
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name QuickBiteAPI --zip-file fileb://quickbite-api.zip
```
