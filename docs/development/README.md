# QuickBite QA - Development Journey

This directory contains the day-by-day development progress of the QuickBite QA project, documenting the structured learning approach and milestone achievements.

## üìÖ Development Timeline

### [Day 1 - Project Foundation](DAY1.md)
**Focus**: Initial project setup and basic structure
- Project initialization and repository setup
- Basic React frontend scaffolding
- FastAPI backend foundation
- Initial development environment configuration
- Basic routing and component structure

### [Day 2 - Full-Stack Implementation](DAY2.md)  
**Focus**: Complete application functionality and AWS deployment
- Complete menu browsing functionality
- Shopping cart implementation with real-time updates
- User authentication with JWT tokens
- Full AWS serverless deployment (S3, Lambda, API Gateway)
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Production-ready application

### [Day 3 - Testing Infrastructure](DAY3.md)
**Focus**: Comprehensive testing automation and quality assurance
- Complete API testing suite with Pactum (9/9 tests passing)
- End-to-end UI testing with Cypress (6/6 tests passing)
- 100% test coverage across critical user journeys
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Automated testing workflows
- Performance validation

### [Day 4 - CI/CD Automation & Blue-Green Deployment](DAY4.md)
**Focus**: Production-ready CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and blue-green deployment
- Complete GitHub Actions workflow automation
- Blue-green deployment strategy implementation
- Comprehensive smoke testing suite (9 test scenarios)
- Manual approval gates for production promotion
- Test artifact collection and monitoring
- Enterprise-grade security and deployment practices

## üéØ Learning Objectives

Each day was structured to demonstrate specific full-stack development concepts:

- **Day 1**: Foundation and setup practices
- **Day 2**: Full-stack integration and cloud deployment
- **Day 3**: Testing automation and quality assurance
- **Day 4**: Performance and production readiness

## üìä Progress Tracking
